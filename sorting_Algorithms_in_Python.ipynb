        "3. Insertion Sort: Builds the final sorted array one item at a time by repeatedly inserting a value into the already sorted portion of the list.\n",
        "4. Merge Sort: Divides the list into smaller sublists, recursively sorts them, and then merges the sublists back together to obtain the final sorted list.\n",
        "5. Quick Sort: Chooses a pivot element and partitions the list into two sublists, one with elements smaller than the pivot and one with elements larger than the pivot. It then recursively applies the same process to the sublists.\n",
        "6. Heap Sort: Builds a binary heap from the list and repeatedly extracts the maximum element from the heap, placing it at the end of the sorted portion.\n",
        "7. Counting Sort: Suitable for sorting integers with a known range, it counts the occurrences of each element and uses this information to determine their positions in the sorted output.\n",
